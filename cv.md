## About Me
  I do not like to stagnate in one place. I am learning something all the time. My brain needs constant recharging. He constantly asks for new information. Because of this feature, I did not work at one place for more than 3 years. And so I found an area where you can study forever. I touched the IT world and realized that we have a very long way ahead of us. This is love forever and my brain will never be bored again.

## Code Example
### Instructions
  If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).
````
  function solution(number){
  let counter =0;
    if(number<=0){return counter;}
    else{
        for(let i=0; i<number; i++){
            if(i%3==0 || i%5==0){
                counter =counter+i;
            }
        }
        return counter;
    }
}
solution(10);
